Lets use the `ls` command

<br>

### Solution
Use `ls` to help see whats in the filesystem


We can list the current directory using

```bash
ls
```{{exec}}


We can add parameters to a linux command to change its behaviour, lets try

`-l` - long listing format (Think "long" or "list")
```bash
ls -l
```{{exec}}
`-a` - all files (Think "all")
```bash
ls -a
```{{exec}}
**Note: now you can see my hidden agenda**

You can combine parameters to get the desired output, I like reading out the parameters as a sentence to help remember them

For exmaple lets see a "list" of "all"
```bash
ls -la
```{{exec}}
